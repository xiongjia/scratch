# SDK
Current supported languages are:
- csharp
- go
- java
- javascript
- python

# Sample bots
for each language, sample bots are provided inside folder "sample_bots".
To use these samples bots, you need first to copy the SDK files on the same folder than the bot code.

For example for Javascript:
- copy ./javascript/*.js ./javascript/sample_bots
- run the engine with one JS bot: ..\try_js_bot.cmd
